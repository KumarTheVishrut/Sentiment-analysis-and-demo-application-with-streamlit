[![Streamlit](https://img.shields.io/badge/Interface-Streamlit-FF4B4B.svg)](https://streamlit.io/)

A machine learning system for sentiment analysis on ML/AI news articles, featuring two different classification models with performance comparison and real-time analysis capabilities.

## Features

- **Dual Model Architecture**
  - Logistic Regression with TF-IDF vectorization
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM) with linear kernel
- **Performance Benchmarking**
  - Side-by-side model comparison
  - Confusion matrix visualization
  - Classification reports
- **Real-time Analysis**
  - Interactive text input interface
  - Confidence level visualization
  - Instant prediction results
- **Local Development Ready**
  - Virtual environment setup
  - Persistent model storage
  - Reproducible training pipeline

## Installation

1. **Clone Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ml-news-sentiment.git
   cd ml-news-sentiment
   ```

2. **Set Up Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv sentiment_env
   source sentiment_env/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### 1. Train Models
```bash
python train_models.py
```

This will:
- Download the dataset from Hugging Face
- Train both models
- Generate performance metrics
- Save models and visualizations

### 2. Launch Dashboard
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

Access the interface at `http://localhost:8501`

### Interface Features

**Performance Comparison Page**
- Side-by-side model metrics
- Confusion matrix heatmaps
- Classification reports

**Real-time Analysis Page**
- Text input field for news articles
- Model selection toggle
- Confidence distribution visualization
- Instant sentiment prediction
